==Changelog

For the complete changelog see the <tt>Changelog</tt>-file in the Redmine New Issue Alerts plugin directory.

==Latest stable release

The currently available, latest stable release of the plugin is version <b>0.0.2</b>.

==Purpose

This plugin can be used to make sure that a new issue is getting the exposure it needs. For instance, you might decide that
any new issue logged on a specific project is sent to a distribution email address. People from that distribution email list 
will then be able to triage the new issue and assign it to the right person.

The reason the plugin was created was because I did not find assign tickets to a group of users using redmine stock functionnalities.
This can, to some extend, resolve http://www.redmine.org/issues/408

People from that group and/or manager will still have to assign the issue to the right person though.

==Compatibility

This plugin should compatible with Redmine 0.9.x, 1.x as well as with the current Redmine trunk.

It was last tested against Redmine 1.2.1

A tab called "Email on New Issue" will appear on project which have enabled the plugin providing that the user has enough credential.

While an option to set email priority is accessible, priority is not a standard email header and behaviour might depend on each email client.
